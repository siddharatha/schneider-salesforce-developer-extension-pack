## pack: schneider-salesforce-developer-extension-pack
Please note that this extension is published by Siddharatha, independently and Schneider is not involved with any specific copyright issues if they come up. This extension is being built to help developers within Schneider, If other companies see the need they can use it.

Please follow the below steps to get started with VSCode. We have collected the extensions you would need to improve your usage of Salesforce with VSCode.

## To Install 
- You would need to have some applications installed to better use the items within this extension.
- https://git-scm.com/ ( install with git-bash, its critical for other extensions)
- https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/ ( to parse json in shell scripts)

## Concepts
- GIT is a source control management system we use to manage our metadata and code .
- It is a distributed version control system, so we need more than 1 step to make sure our changes are moved to the central repository.
- pull, stage, commit , push - are the steps we constantly follow to make sure our changes are available in the central repo.
- Except for release branches, your developer branch is managed by you.
